Where I keep my MATLAB projects on GITHub

This is where I now keep my MATLAB code. I am writing code based on the Book, 'Computational Physics' by Giordano 
and Nakanishi. I wrote a lab manual for the Book. you can take a look at it here, 
http://www.physics.purdue.edu/~hisao/book/www/Computational%20Physics%20using%20MATLAB.pdf
Any new code for the manual will be developed (slowly!) right here on GIT. 
Thanks for looking.
